	To begin, let's define the Agile methodology in the context of project management. Agile can be understood as an iterative process for the execution of a project that is continually evolving as it progresses.

	One of the key benefits for using an agile methodology for your project is that particular stages of the project cycle can garner quick feedback and from this feedback, proposed changes can be implemented rather quickly. This makes Agile an attractive choice when considering quicker methodologies for a project. Each branch of the iterative cycle is called a sprint; or a set period of time in which a particular amount of work is completed. The project manager decides what work and how much work is to be completed within a sprint. The benefit here is that a good project manager can assign just enough work to optimize a sprint while ensuring that the workers aren't being overworked or underworked, which can lead to burnout, missed deadlines, or budget surpluses depending on how much/how little work is being completed.

	When each and every team member is engaged with the project on the level that Agile forces them to be, it creates a higher quality end product. Furthermore, as the team continues work on the project, they are honing their skills and improving themselves which in turn translates into a better end product.
</p>

<p>
	Another benefit of Agile is that it keeps the customer in the loop and makes them feel very much a part of the decision making process. The scrum team: every member involved in the Agile project management process, works closely with the client to ensure that their needs are being met and the product reflects what they want, this leads to higher customer satisfaction and retention rates. Customers that are satisfied with the outcome of a project are more likely to give repeat business to the scrum team.
</p>

<p>
	Transparency in the Agile methodology allows the project managers to implement quality control changes on the fly. Progress reports are given frequently which allows for fine tuning and control over the entire project.
</p>

<p>
	Sprints in Agile allow for a high degree of deliverability. Because the sprint schedule is fixed, deliverables are handed in on a predictable timeline. The end product can benefit from this fixed schedule because testing opportunities arrive when things are ahead of schedule.
</p>

<p>
	Agile has a notorious reputation for being extremely flexible, especially when compared to other methodologies. The sprints that the project gets divided into allow for changes on short notice. Changes can also be planned for the next sprint if need be.
</p>

<p>
	There's also a solid risk mitigation aspect during sprints. Because of all the transparency in the project process, minor issues can be detected and ousted early on before they grow to become a larger issue. This makes it so that the end product has a greater overall chance of succeeding.
</p>

<p>
	Because of the quick pacing of sprints and the rapid development cycle, team members are forced to communicate with each other on a quick timeline. Daily meetings are common when you're part of an agile team. E-mail or voice calls in a pinch can make sure that short notice changes can be made while keeping everyone on the same page in the development cycle. Burndown charts are very helpful in this aspect because they can accurately track progress through what has been done and what plans to get done.
