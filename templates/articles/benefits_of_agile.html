	Mohamad Moumneh�s Story: As a new project manager, I would like to read an informative (yet readable) blog post about the benefits of Agile that has illustrations which provide context to the subject so that I can learn more about Agile and be a better Agile project manager / Scrum master.

</p>

<p>Feature definition: Understanding project management process groups and the five steps of the project life cycle. </p>

<p>
	To begin, let's define the Agile methodology in the context of project management. Agile can be understood as an iterative process for the execution of a project that is continually evolving as it progresses.

	One of the key benefits for using an agile methodology for your project is that particular stages of the project cycle can garner quick feedback and from this feedback, proposed changes can be implemented rather quickly. This makes Agile an attractive choice when considering quicker methodologies for a project. Each branch of the iterative cycle is called a sprint; or a set period of time in which a particular amount of work is completed. The project manager decides what work and how much work is to be completed within a sprint. The benefit here is that a good project manager can assign just enough work to optimize a sprint while ensuring that the workers aren't being overworked or underworked, which can lead to burnout, missed deadlines, or budget surpluses depending on how much/how little work is being completed.

	When each and every team member is engaged with the project on the level that Agile forces them to be, it creates a higher quality end product. Furthermore, as the team continues work on the project, they are honing their skills and improving themselves which in turn translates into a better end product.
</p>

<p>
	Another benefit of Agile is that it keeps the customer in the loop and makes them feel very much a part of the decision making process. The scrum team: every member involved in the Agile project management process, works closely with the client to ensure that their needs are being met and the product reflects what they want, this leads to higher customer satisfaction and retention rates. Customers that are satisfied with the outcome of a project are more likely to give repeat business to the scrum team.
</p>

<p>
	Transparency in the Agile methodology allows the project managers to implement quality control changes on the fly. Progress reports are given frequently which allows for fine tuning and control over the entire project.
</p>

<p>
	Sprints in Agile allow for a high degree of deliverability. Because the sprint schedule is fixed, deliverables are handed in on a predictable timeline. The end product can benefit from this fixed schedule because testing opportunities arrive when things are ahead of schedule.
</p>

<p>
	Agile has a notorious reputation for being extremely flexible, especially when compared to other methodologies. The sprints that the project gets divided into allow for changes on short notice. Changes can also be planned for the next sprint if need be.
</p>

<p>
	There's also a solid risk mitigation aspect during sprints. Because of all the transparency in the project process, minor issues can be detected and ousted early on before they grow to become a larger issue. This makes it so that the end product has a greater overall chance of succeeding.
</p>

<p>
	Because of the quick pacing of sprints and the rapid development cycle, team members are forced to communicate with each other on a quick timeline. Daily meetings are common when you're part of an agile team. E-mail or voice calls in a pinch can make sure that short notice changes can be made while keeping everyone on the same page in the development cycle. Burndown charts are very helpful in this aspect because they can accurately track progress through what has been done and what plans to get done.

<p>
	Interestingly enough if a company decides that Agile isn�t meeting all their needs, they have the option of combining other methodologies such as Waterfall with Agile. This makes Agile an even more flexible and adaptable process.
</p>

<p>
	A less talked about benefit of Agile is how much software is available to support the Agile framework. Many project management tools exist that support different frameworks within the Agile camp. Someone looking to get onto an Agile team could benefit from learning one of the many softwares available to them, although be wary that certain companies may be inclined to use specific software. Another thing that someone could do to prepare themselves to be on an Agile project is to get one of many available certifications in Agile. A list of certifications can be found here:

		<li>Initiating process: this takes place during every phase and is important for documenting how work will get done, the lessons learned from the work, and customer approval of the work being done. </li>
		<li>Planning process: Many considerations are taken into account during this phase. The organizations needs, the customers needs, the scope of the project, the schedule, </li>
		<li>Executing process: The actual work is carried out. This part can also be iterated on through communication of team members. </li>
		<li>Monitoring and controlling process: Every so often a project must be looked at and analyzed to see if the objectives are being met. This is a crucial step to ensure a good outcome. </li>
		<li>Closing process: The project is finalized and delivered. Important lessons can be drawn from retroactively looking at the project as a whole. </li>
