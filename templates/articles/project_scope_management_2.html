<h2>Why should you use Agile methodology?</h2>
<p>In project management, it can be difficult to develop a complex project due to the scope of the project requirements being extensive. When it comes to developing a project, Agile has the highest success rate out of all of the project management methodologies. Due to Agile's unique scoping process, project managers are able to easily make changes along the project's development. </p>
<p>The extent of requirements and features varies quite a lot from project to project. Agile's focus on completing smaller chunks of the project each sprint is essential to its success. After each sprint, the project management team can redefine their scope after completing the functionality of a feature. If the requirements for the project change along the way, those adjustments can easily be made.</p>
<h2>How should scope be defined in Agile?</h2>
<p>Defining scope is easily the most important aspect of Agile methodology. Agile's scope definition is also what makes it unique to other project management methodologies. In a blog post published by Medium.com, Thulazshini Tamilchelvan defines the elements that should be included in a project's scope: “In the world of project management, scope outlines the features or requirements to be accomplished and the resources needed to deliver them successfully within set deadlines.” After every single sprint, these elements of the scope definition must be redefined and approved. </p>

<h2>The importance of collaboration when defining scope</h2>
<p>Since the scope must be redefined after every sprint, the project management team and product owner must all play a part in influencing the development process. The product owner must specifically define the importance of each project's features while setting deadlines for the implementation. That being said, it is of the utmost importance for the project scope to be collaboratively defined by all members involved in the project. If all members of the project management team are not involved in the definition of scope, the project will more than likely fall apart. Even if just one person is not involved in the scope definition process, this can prove to be seriously problematic.</p>
<p>In project management, Agile methodology's extensiveness can lead to exhausted team members. The rapid changes to development and scope definition can cause project deadlines to be constantly prolonged. As well, team members may find themselves working on project features that may not ever receive implementation. For example, a project management team might spend an entire sprint working on a new feature that needs to be added; however, after approaching a problem in the next sprint, the project management team may realize that they have to scrap that idea entirely. Although this will lead to the end product being more effective, it can lead to frustration and a lack of motivation for team members working on the project. That is why it is so important for the project team to be full of motivated individuals who are incentivized by having a quality end product.</p>
<h2>The importance of clearly defining roles in Agile</h2>
<p>In addition to the potential issues already mentioned, the nature of Agile methodology can lead to a lot of differing opinions between both the project manager and the product owner. The rapid changes in development with Agile methodology call for more chances for potential features to be added, as well as more opportunities for existing features to be altered. When you have many people working on a project, the responsibilities essentially have to be defined at the start of the project. Although the roles need to be clearly defined, the roles assigned to the development team should definitely be altered throughout the project if needed. With clearly defined roles, the responsibilities of decision-making are spread out through the development team. This will help to minimize disagreements between team members. Although differences in opinion will always still occur throughout development, it shouldn't happen nearly as often with clearly defined roles.</p>

<p>The diagram above defines the product team, which is primarily run by the Scrum team. The Scrum team consists of three main roles: the product owner, the scrum master, and the development team. The development team is responsible for the bulk of the development process. The product owner and scrum master serve to assist the development team and set deadlines. </p>

<h2>What role does the development team have?</h2>
<p>The development team is entirely responsible for the work done on creating the product. They also are equally responsible for the planning and scope definitions for the product. In the definition provided by Atlassian.com, they compare the role of the scrum development team to a construction team: “You can think of it in the same way as when you have a house project and you hire a developer. They develop the project and do the work. Yes, this might mean they lay bricks, do plumbing, even dig holes, but the person is known as a developer.” In this example, the construction team must be involved in both the planning and the work done on the product they are producing. The development team for almost any project that uses Agile methodology is always going to be involved in defining the scope for the project. It simply just doesn't make sense to have a separate team assigned to define the project's scope. Since the development team is physically working on the product, they will likely also have the most insight for defining the project scope.</p>
<p>The development team generally consists of around a dozen people. It is essential to make sure that the development team is neither too large or too small. You want to have a large enough team to complete the project in an efficient amount of time. However, if the team is too big, there will be to many people responsible for making decisions and that can lead to conflicts. Having too many development team members can lead to overlaps in work and overall cause unnecessary issues.</p>
