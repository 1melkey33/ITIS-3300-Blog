    Our feature is project scope management, specifically key takeaways for new project managers within the context of project scope management in Agile.
</p>
<h2></h2>

<p>When it comes to project management there are a lot of decisions that have to be made.
    Sometimes those decisions can cost a lot of money and sometimes they can save money.
    As a project manager you are always having to think about what to do if this or that happens?
    So, you have to prepare for anything and everything because you do not want to hold a project
    up which could end up costing a lot more money because the project was delayed.
    As a project manager you have to be able to analyze the whole project in order to be able to
    prepare for mistakes being made or unexpected problems that can occur.
    This is where project estimation comes in for agile project management to help the project
    management team to think about all of these actions.
</p>

<h2>What is Agile Estimation?</h2>

<p>
    Agile estimation is where the project management team tries to come up with how much a project will cost, how long the project will take,
    and how many people are required to get the project accomplished that will satisfy the customer or business that they are working for.
    Throughout the estimation process the project management team has to be prepared for changes or any type of obstacle that may happen.
    Agile estimation tries guesstimate on what problems will happen and how to counter them so that they are well prepared for when it happens.
    It allows them to act quickly and everything to go smoothly because they were prepared for it in case if it did happen.
    When doing estimates, they rarely do change and the only time that it should change is when what is needed has changed.

<h2>Estimating an Agile Projects Scope</h2>
<p>Agile estimates are important because the project management team has a deadline, and it makes them have to uphold to the limit that was set.
    Estimation helps the team to know when the project will be completed or a more roundabout time frame.
    If the team has an end goal and knows what to do it helps them to be a better team and to get the job done.
    Agile estimation helps the project management team to be able to make better decisions and to plan what to do next.
    It helps them to be able to strategize on what to do and what parts of the project need each other to work better.
    Estimation also helps the project management team to stay within the budget that is given to them and to not to go over too much if the team does go over the limit.
    The team in agile project management has to be flexible and have the ability to produce products in a timely manner.
    When a person is a project manager it is good to have an estimation as to how long a project will take to complete.
    If a project ends up taking too long, then it could end up costing the company a lot of money.
    If everything is looked over and analyzed at every step, then it is easier for the project manager to make the right decisions.
    If estimation is done correctly, it could help the company by saving more money if the project is able to get done sooner than is expected.
    There are steps that can help in agile estimation to know when the project will be completed, how much it will cost and determine how much work everyone will have to put in to get the job done.
    Agile estimation helps to be able to keep the project team on task. While doing the project it is always good to constantly ask yourself or your teammates whether you are meeting the requirements of the client.
    You must periodically check with the experts on the team to make sure that everyone is meeting the deadline and is on task.
