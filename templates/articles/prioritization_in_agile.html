<p>Determining prioritization for a project schedule is fundamental to a project’s success. Given Agile’s incremental approach to project development, it is essential for your development team to deliver high-priority features consistently. There are many reasons that make prioritization an essential part of a project schedule in Agile methodology.</p>
<p>A great first step in project scheduling is setting out your priorities. Regardless of how efficient these priorities are, you atleast know what you are focusing on for each sprint. The last thing you want is for your development team to have a split effort towards separate priorities. A customer awaiting the product will need to see progress; focusing all efforts onto a single priority or feature is the most efficient way to do so.</p>
<p>The customer should be held at the highest value of consideration with determining priority. The customer, with whom the project is being developed for, will want to see substantial progress on the implementation of major features. The major features should be targeted first, as it will provide the customer with the highest rate of return on the investment they have made for that project. In certain situations, it is possible that the major features must not be started until other features have already been implemented. In that case, it may be that the major features of the project have not been entirely mapped out yet. Regardless, the customer should ideally be involved in every step of determining prioritization of a project schedule. If prioritization is not properly considered, the project development will have a much lower success rate.</p>
<p>Although the customer should be the main focus when defining prioritization, there are many other things that contribute to the importance of determining prioritization in Agile. Given the adaptability of Agile, project schedules should be defined at the start of every sprint. Agile methodology excels at keeping customers updated with their evolving needs, so prioritization for each sprint needs to be thoroughly considered. Although Agile methodology focuses on incremental prioritization, it is essential to have forward thinking with decision making and to have the end product envisioned.</p>

<h1>How should prioritization be defined within Agile project scheduling?</h1>
<p>Priorities should be defined in Agile with both insight and focus in mind. If priorities are not planned effectively, it can lead to several different issues. For one, not having any priorities means that your development team has no direction or goals to focus on. This can obviously lead to split up efforts on different features of the project, which both delays the project and complicates it. Aswell, you want to make sure that you are targeting major features with your priorities. You don’t want to focus on the minor features first, as you would likely want to showcase a more impressive amount of progress to the customer of the product. Although Agile methodology focuses on completing features in smaller incrementations, it is also essential to have some sort of a vision of the end product. That is, so you can plan out your prioritization accordingly. Especially in software development projects, alot of the features may require pre requisite features to be completed beforehand.</p>
<p>In conclusion, you need to make sure that you prioritize your basic building block features first. Regardless of how impressive the feature, the development for most types of projects should start from the ground up, similar to a building.</p>

<h1>Helpful tools to use for project scheduling with Agile</h1>
<p>A product backlog is used to manage prioritization within project scheduling. A product backlog is essentially defined as a dynamic list of features and tasks ranked by priority. Features are described as user stories and are ranked on a number scale, with the lowest number noting the highest priority. An example of a user story could be, “As a user, I would like to be able to use a search bar to find a specific blog post.” In addition to the user story and priority ranking, each task is assigned a story point value. Story points determine the difficulty or amount of resources required to complete the given task. Generally ranking from 1-5(5 being most difficult), story points provide the entire team an insight on the extent of the upcoming project schedule. The entire product backlog should be changed and reevaluated by all members of the scrum team; this should be done after every single sprint, as priorities will likely change. </p>
<p>A Kanban board utilizes the product backlog to visualize the entire development process. Each column of a Kanban board represents a different stage of development. The Kanban board starts with the product backlog, which maps out the details and priority ranking of each task, and moves tasks to the following column. The following column is the active column, which any task in the process of development is moved to. Once a feature has been developed, it must first be reviewed and tested before it is considered complete. </p>

<p>These are two of the most essential tools used for project scheduling and defining prioritization. The backlog acting as a dynamic ranking and ordering of tasks creates a sense of organization and a plan of action for the development team. The Kanban board also helps create a sense of organization by combining the product backlog with a progress board. </p>
<p>The Kanban board is great for Agile methodology, since it keeps the entire scrum team updated with any new progress. The scrum team includes the scrum master, product owner, and development team. Since the development team are the ones exclusively responsible for the physical work done on the project, it is important to make sure that both the scrum master and product owner can visualize this progress. Again, project planning project should equally include all members of the scrum team. It is just the physical work that is done exclusively by the development team.</p>
