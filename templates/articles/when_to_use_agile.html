	Kyle's Story: As a new project manager, I would like to read an informative (yet readable) blog post about the when to use or not use the Agile methodology that has illustrations which provide context to the subject so that I can learn more about Agile and be a better Agile project manager / Scrum master.

<p>What is Agile methodology? </p>
<p>Agile is a highly flexible methodology used by many in the project management process. Often used in app development, agile is the most effective when working on more complex products.</p>
<p>What is unique about Agile methodology?</p>
<p>All product development methodologies start with a planning process; however, agile is unique in that it doesn't set any concrete requirements. After the product brainstorming and design process, the product begins the development process. Agile's development process is unique in the same way that it doesn't follow any real instructions. Since there is no “how to” in the development process, this process can often be prolonged as the development team figures out the correct implementation.</p>
<p>Keys to success with Agile methodology</p>
<p>Consistent meetings on a daily basis are a necessary component of the Agile methodology. Given how dynamic Agile is, changes are going to be made often. Whether these changes are large or small, it is important that all team members stay updated in agreement to these changes. Whenever the product implementation takes any kind of a change in direction, it should be required that all members agree to the change. Agile methodology can succeed through multiple different paths of development. You want to try to prevent an overlap or loss of potential, from having team members focus on developing something that never receives implementation. It is almost never too late to make changes to your product, even when you are in the final stages of development. Through the testing process, problems can come up forcing your team to make changes to the product. However, making changes can cause the product completion timeline to get delayed. If the development team is designing a product for a company, the company can grow frustrated by delays. With that being said, it is important to keep the company updated on the progress. Companies may also grow frustrated by the direction the product is going in. As we know, it is essential for the entire development team to be involved in making key decisions. You must also assure that the company is ok with making these changes.</p>
<p>What downsides are there with Agile methodology?</p>
<p>Agile has no long term deadlines so it can be difficult to invision the end result, until the project is close to reaching completion. Given how Agile focuses on completing short term deadlines, each short term deadline has a large influence on the next. The testing process of Agile methodology can prove complicated as errors can delay the timeline. Although Agile is a flexible methodology, that flexibility is limited by the organization of which you are producing this product for. That is why companies that cannot allow flexibility in the product design process are often not suitable to use Agile methodology. Agile is a difficult methodology to execute in product development, as it is a more improvised process. There are no instructions or guideline set for the product development, so the development team must use their own insight to make adjustments. You should ensure that your team has the adequate motivation, leadership, and skills required, in order to be successful in this process.</p>
<p>Should you use Agile or Waterfall methodology?</p>
<p>If you are a company or development team that is developing a low complexity product, then Agile methodology probably wouldn't make sense. If you already have a destination in mind for your product, then it doesn't make sense use Agile methodology. Agile should be used for complex, high-quiality, long-term product development. Often agile is used for app development given the complexity of it. Waterfall is a similar methodology used in product development. Waterfall methodology is unique in the way that the process is planned out. The planning stage involves mapping out every step of the process and setting deadlines for each step. When you have a deadline for every step of the process, you can assure that the product timeline doesn't get delayed. The organization that needs the product can also be assured of when the product will be completed. Although, Waterfall methodology doesn't allow for much flexibility, given how the end product is already envisioned at the early stages of development. It would be very difficult to make a change to your product after the process has already been mapped out. At that point, you would rather have to remap your process from the start. Agile has statistically proven to be more successful for companies than waterfall over the years. The chart below from Vitality Chicago shows percentages from “10,000 projects from the Standish Group database from the years 2011 to 2015.”  It is evident that Agile is significantly more successful than Waterfall. Agile also proves to have a much lower failure rate. I interpret that the fail rate and success rate are worse for Waterfall due to the lack of flexibility it has. It would make sense that a more flexible product would succeed at a higher rate and fail at a lower rate.</p>

<p>Although it seems that Agile would be the obvious choice, one cannot be sure that Waterfall may not prove more successful in certain circumstances. Again, Waterfall may work better for low complexity projects that have a time restraint. Given the lower complexity, this will allow for the entire product design process to be mapped out ahead of time. Then, deadline can be set for every step of the way ensuring that the product development is completed on time.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>It is obvious that Agile methodology shouldn't be used for every product. However, it can be easily decided which methodology to use, by looking at the complexity and urgency of the product development process.</p>
